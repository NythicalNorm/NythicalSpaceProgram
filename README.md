# Voxel Space Program

#### A Valkyrien Skies 2 Addon (for forge 1.20.1)

Welcome to Voxel Space Program.

A minecraft mod that aims to make space exploration challenging not through hard to get recipes or rare items but through you having to build rockets taking into consideration the Thrust to weight ratio, delta-V and Rocket Staging etc...

With all the expected features such as time warp, a solar system map screen, maneuver nodes, seamlessly switching between different satellites, At least a dozen planetary bodies,
and multiplayer! (with global time warp with a voting system not the different timelines like the KSP multiplayer mod.) 
Set in a truly big Solar System with planets millions of kms away. Currently at the beginning stages of work, but you are welcome to look through the source code.

I have decided to split off the part of mod that deals with space rendering, Handling VS ships in space and Orbital Mechanics etc... into a library mod for this mod called PlanetShine, for Players there is no change from the initial plan
except this mod requires another dependency but for modpack / mod makers the library might be useful for those needing planets and stuff without requiring the blocks and items that are like the rocket parts from KSP,
(VS engines and stuff from other mods will work in space so you can still move around in space with the PlanetShine mod, Note that any blocks based on aerodynamics such as propellers from clockwork will not work in space)
Voxel Space Program is the mod that will add the survival friendly manufacturing blocks, rocket engines, Command seats, Propellant Tanks and the specific planet Dimensions, PlanetShine is mainly a lib mod that allows a lot of Datapacks to customize it for creating planets out of any dimension from any mod.
